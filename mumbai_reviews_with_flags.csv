to make matters worse, he couldn‚Äôt tell the difference between curly-wavy hair and frizz, and seemed unaware of how the curly girl method (cgm) works. also, he kept denying that he didn‚Äôt cut the hair short and it‚Äôs still long enough. if a hair stylist can‚Äôt tell the difference between butt length hair vs upper back length hair, he doesn‚Äôt fulfil the bare minimum to be called a barber.

i have to preface that i was incredibly late to my appointment due to terrible traffic. i told the staff that i completely understood if they couldn‚Äôt fit me in anymore. they were very kind in fitting me in. however, if the resulting haircut is due to a rush job i would have rather not received the haircut at all.

i asked for a shag, with layers and a soft fringe. i had been in contact with the team through whatsapp and provided reference images, then also showed the stylist the reference photo attached. i said i wanted curtain bangs that were a bit short at the front and sweeping to the length of my cheekbone (as seen in photo). i also notified the stylist of my cowlick, as it impacts how bangs sit, but it was obviously not taken into account.

i was trusting the process when there was lots of fringe cutting. at the end, the stylist asked how i would like it blow dried and i said just leaving it naturally messy. but it was just a mess. my fringe was incredibly thick, uneven, and layered.

the photo outside the salon is how i left. the layers are all over the place, and the fringe is super uneven. i have been wearing scarves on my head every single day since!

date of visit: 15 july 2025
branch staff: bhagyesh (reception), zoya (manager)
what happened
booking confirmation vs. reception denial‚Äì booked a haircut for 7:30‚ÄØpm under a rs‚ÄØ549 offer via both mine and my mother's phone numbers. ‚Äì at 7:15‚ÄØpm, i was told i had a 7‚ÄØpm slot‚Äînot 7:30‚Äîdespite showing my confirmation sms. bhagyesh insisted the offer was valid only for my mother‚Äôs number.

refusal of payment & delay tactics ‚Äì even after offering to pay full price, they refused. zoya claimed only one technician was available and scheduled us post 8:30‚ÄØpm‚Äîdespite another stylist being free.

blatant hypocrisy & gender bias ‚Äì zoya said, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt ask female employees to wait long‚Äù‚Äîyet 2‚Äì3 female technicians were actively servicing clients at that time. this explanation was not only hypocritical but deeply unacceptable.

disrespect toward a senior citizen ‚Äì my unwell, senior mother received zero empathy or basic courtesy‚Äîno water or beverage, no proper seating, and no consideration for her comfort or dignity.
intimidation tactics & verbal harassment ‚Äì when i mentioned writing a review and photographing staff, zoya threatened to call the police and told me to ‚Äúget out of her salon‚Äù as if it were her personal property. bhagyesh remained dismissive, though he allowed me to photograph him.

no resolution, no accountability ‚Äì after a 40‚Äëminute wait, zoya refused to reschedule. staff gave contradictory reasons for discount eligibility, and when i requested to see the terms & conditions, zoya flat‚Äëout refused.

appalling service ‚Äì at 8:10‚ÄØpm, i asked they at least service my mother. bhagyesh agreed‚Äîbut then backed out. after forcing us to wait an hour, they completely ignored her needs.

final thoughts enrich salon at ashoka towers served up an atrocious customer experience‚Äîrude, dismissive staff; inconsistent and misleading communication; clear gender bias; intimidation; and utter neglect of a vulnerable senior citizen. you're not the only one noticing a decline in customer service across branches. many have reported disorganized reception, extended waits, overpriced add-ons, and unprofessional behavior. if you value respect, clarity, and genuine care, this place is a hard pass. this experience ranks as the worst salon visit i‚Äôve ever had.",1752657735,a month ago,en,Sonakshi Lodha,False,True,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,True,True

they initially told me a full 90 mins massage and then shower.

after doing a massage for 40 mins they said time is up.

asked him if he would like a happy ending. my husband was alarmed and immediately asked to be switched to a different type of massage and masseuse. it was very clear that all three of us were asking for swedish massages. we went back to the management and tried to tell them about it and basically the manager turned it around and said that how do you know that my husband wasn‚Äôt trying to solicit her? what a deplorable act of turning this situation around to cover up the shady practices happening in this business. an absolutely disgusting way to run a business and there is no recourse!  i would report them to the police but the manager was cocky, defensive, and immensely corrupt and probably would bribe the police. in short, he was an absolute and complete bully.

i would also check if they have hidden cameras in the room. we went back and checked but it‚Äôs not impossible to hide cameras nowadays in virtually any place. unless you are actually wanting sexual favors, i would stay away from this place. i suspect the google reviews are made up. what a disgusting abhorrent establishment! the person at the front desk was complicit in this as he too didn‚Äôt make eye contact. illegal trafficking of women is not uncommon in many parts of the world but it was astounding to see it happen before our eyes. i would stay away from this business!  i know the owner will respond with what he said to us in person that how do we know my husband didn‚Äôt initiate it, but this is just another way to cover up their shady practices. if he wanted a ‚Äúhappy ending‚Äù, he would have gotten one, but he went for a legal swedish massage. i feel bad for these poor women who have to do this to survive. despicable and disgusting business!",1752084570,a month ago,en,M D,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,True

after detailed discussion about the preferences about the massage. i was taken to the massage room which is beautifully designed.

started off with washing the feet in warm water infused with rose petals, it instantly switched me to the relax mode.

the masseuse was too good at her service. just when i thought the massage was done, a warm pillow was kept below my neck. the best was yet to come. this hot pillow was later used to relax the back and the shoulders. this made the experience magical.

ending the procedure with steam followed by warm rose petal tea and their customised chocolate. they surprised me with a pastry as it was my birthday.

the balinese massage felt more like a deep tissue treatment, and the masseuse was neither clear in her communication  when asked to differentiate. when i requested for the temperature to be increased due to how cold the room was, there was a lack of empathy or concern until much later.
after the session, i wasn‚Äôt offered the customary tea or fruit, which is usually a part of the spa experience. to top it off, i was informed that the payment machine was not working and was asked to transfer the amount to the personal account of the receptionist ‚Äî and no receipt was provided.

but sadly, the masseuse they assigned to me was substandard. instead of making me relax during the scrub, she folded my legs upright and started scrubbing the back of my legs while i was made to balance my legs. so instead of going into a deep relaxing state, i was made to now balance my legs and stay awake. the worse was when she asked me to sit upright so she could scrub my back! and the manager said that she is from ananda spa. this was a big joke!

plus, they charge for the 10 minute steam, that is offered complimentary everywhere else. their reasoning is that they have to block the room. i fail to understand that if i am taking 2 hour session back to back, how is 10 minutes going to cause them loss of income?

the manager is extremely money minded and shallow. he doesn't even want to hire the best, in sync with the brand. they are only interested in making more money and not concerned about maintaining top class masseuse or offering top class services or thinking long term.

he had promised he will get back to me about the complimentary steam i had requested the very next day of my spa visit, but i had to follow up with him after a week. there is no professionalism and very little service orientation in this organisation.

such spas run only because of an international brand they piggyback on. there are other local spas that are superb and very well priced too! even taj landsend spa doesn't charge for their steam when you go there for a massage. so why would i travel all the way from bandra to central mumbai to visit this substandard spa?

mahesh did an excellent job giving me a pedicure, guiding me on what to do to prevent dry feet, and doing his best to make sure i was satisfied. highly recommend, ask for him when you visit!

i came for a deep tissue massage at the white door and was very satisfied with the service. i've been to other spas at this same price point (palms spa, myrah spa) and this one was far better than both.

the room was well-equipped and very modern, the masseuse was polite and professional and the shower was well stocked.

the massage bed was even heated, which was a very nice touch.

afterwards, i was not made to rush, and could enjoy the steam and shower at my own pace - she even told me i could lock the door! a far cry from places where the masseuse is literally in the room while i shower and change, which is uncomfortable.

the only nitpick that i had was that both the bath mat and the sheets on the bed seemed a bit dirty - there was some hair from the previous client on the bed as well (see pictures).

i had visited metta foot reflexology spa centre by the visually impaired (bandra) along with a couple of friends and hands down it's one of the best relaxing, rejuvenating and calming experiences if you like to indulge in massage or reflexology therapy that is.

its humble vibes, hygienic environment, skilled expertise makes you already plan your next visit here.

what is so inspiring, that it's so efficiently managed by the team that you leave feeling grateful and lucky to have discovered them honestly.

trust me when i say this - the value they provide in a little over - half a thousand in 60 min is priceless! (we paid rs 600 [weekend rate] per head/ plus tip as per our liking). do make a visit if you are in and around bandra for sure and even if you are not, trust, you will appreciate and it will be totally worth your travel time too üòäüåª
do make a prior appointment to make the most of it. also check with them on the latest pricing list.

when i went for my first trial not only did i see a very confident make-up artist who knew her work but also as we spoke i realised that she was very knowledgeable. i was very particular about my base and to my surprise she is one of the rarest make-up artists that i have known who actually understands indian skin, textured skin. she was very particular about her blending and the base was on point. my make-up for each function looked very natural but yet bridal at the same time.
for my wedding i had 5 functions and for each  function her colour schemes were very different, young, vibrant, playful and yet subtle at the same time. she knows her colours and does a very very good job with it.
for my pheras i had bought a beautiful pastel lehenga. could you imagine shades of blue for an eye make-up on the day of pheras. that tint of blue just uplifted my entire look.

i recently visited curl care with a friend, and the experience was appalling. despite booking an appointment 4 days in advance, we encountered numerous issues.

*key problems:*

1. *rescheduling issues:* they kept asking us to reschedule despite confirming our booking earlier.
2. *wrong directions:* the owner provided incorrect directions, leading to a 45-minute delay as we navigated through thane east to west.
3. *unhygienic conditions:* the salon was dirty, with wet towels being passed off as ""humid."" this is unacceptable and raises serious concerns about their cleanliness standards.
4. *rushed services:* our spa services were rushed, with the massage lasting less than a minute.
5. *price discrepancies:* the prices on their website didn't match the actual charges. we were charged extra for hair length, and the owner kept changing the amount, trying to extract more money from us.

*bill discrepancies:*

- initial price: 1599
- expected bill: 3878 (after adding haircut for normal length 1000)
- final bill: 6500 (including gst)

few pointers that are necessary to know:
1. they don't mix the colour in front of you so you are not sure whether the product used is really what you're paying for and after spending around 3 or more hrs left with no energy to object for a wrong colour done.
2. the jr staff boys are very rough and careless in their service, though knowing well how sensitive the head/scalp n face skin is.
3. too much of talking and are more concerned about (good feedback) positive ratings instead of keeping a watch and making sure the service at each step is being done carefully
4. irrespective of the premium product they claim and expertise of their hair dresser, yet in my personal opinion it is way too costly. trust me. not a single review on google mentions about this aspect.

i had to visit a dermatologist and get treated, so that extra expense of consultation and medicines and cream plus got scolded from her too.

in all this was a highly disappointing experience and too heavy on my pocket incurring unwanted expenses. i wish i could get it recovered from the salon.

the staff is extremely polite and the quality of service is just amazing!
the owner is extremely down to earth and assists you very well. his suggestions are extremely amazing!
i am using their services from last 5 years and the trust i have is commendable.
the only thing in recent times i felt a bit scamy is when they get any offers.
so their pick a tie offer usually comes around women's day where you pick a tie and you can get some discount vouchers.
on instagram and in the salon nowhere it was mentioned that the voucher you get can't be redeemed the same day, infact they had advertised as ""no conditions apply"" which means no conditions applied whatsoever.
i got a voucher of 200rs which they told that i can't redeem it on the same day and when i asked to their staff why i can't redeem as it clearly says ""no conditions apply"" to that they mentioned now we are saying it verbally and the same response i received from owner's wife.
i genuinely felt that hair castle is not just a business making chain but they do care on how their image is in public but this experience made me think otherwise.
i feel in initial days of this salon things were better and soon as you get some success that's when things starts changing.
anyways after taking services of something around 10-15k the 200rs. voucher didn't even matter but this says how things change from trustable to just scamming customers by attracting them with offers.
because the back page of the voucher had nothing mentioned that you can't use it on the same day and when i highlighted that to owner's wife she just told ""now we are saying verbally and we can't print everything on the voucher.
my experience was bitter, 200rs doesn't matter but my outlook changed.",1741441400,5 months ago,en,sonali shah,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True

dear mr. jawed habib,

i recently visited your ghatkopar branch after returning from kuwait, and i would like to share my experience:
1.	the haircut i received was not up to the mark and did not meet my expectations.
2.	the hair coloring was poorly done ‚Äî the application was uneven, and the color was not properly cleaned from the sides of my head.
3.	i was charged ‚Çπ1000 for the hair color service, which i feel was not worth the quality of work provided.
4.     overall, the service was disappointing. the staff seemed untrained and lacked professionalism. i am extremely dissatisfied and would rate this experience zero stars.

i hope you take this feedback seriously and take the necessary steps to improve your service quality and staff training.

this felt like a place which had experience with short hair and would like to give a good short haircut. i read reviews about chrysanne doing great work and also being able to suggest what works for people based on their hair shape etc. i needed this. much to my surprise, i got chrysanne assigned to me too.

the haircut costed me around rs. 1700, and.. it was totally worth it. i finally got a bob cut with the kind of layers i wanted, after showing chrysanne some pictures and getting her suggestions.

i am someone who doesn't put much effort into styling my hair and i told her that. she understood that and the other things i mentioned, and gave me a cut i am excited about! she told me to trust her at one point during the cut when i was confused/ asking many questions, and that helped ease me into the process. i am so happy with the result! :)

i've uploaded two pics for people like me who want short hair. the one with earphones is how it looked after blow drying (in fact i asked her to wet it a little after blow drying so it wasn't too curved inwards because i'm not a big fan of that). the one without earphones is how it looked after i had a hair wash after returning home (something i just do out of habit after getting a haircut).

while the parlour did pitch some hair care products to me, they seemed good, and they didn't push me much about it. they just suggested it and gave me time and space to decide if i wanted it or not. it had some good ingredients and is to hydrate hair which i need, so let's see how it goes.

overall, i know where i'll go for the future cuts too, going forward, and i'll definitely try to go at a time when i can get chrysanne's help. she knows what she's doing :). thank you chrysanne for giving me the kind of haircut i've wanted for years but didn't get in other places! :') wish you all the best :)",1741538703,5 months ago,en,Bhairevi Aiyer,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

the result? my hair looked exactly the same. i had asked for face-framing curtain bangs and he just took a chunk of hair and snipped it off. i went for the haircut a month before my birthday thinking it would settle in and start to look better but i left feeling disappointed and with frizzier hair than before.

during my first appointment, i had booked a gel polish removal and a new gel polish application. even though we arrived on time, we were made to wait over 30 minutes without any communication or update from your team. i politely informed the staff multiple times that i was on a tight schedule and requested that they speed up the process, but i was repeatedly told ‚Äúfive more minutes‚Äù with no real effort to accommodate. while the actual nail technician did a wonderful job‚Äîshe was professional, efficient, and patient while i selected my colors‚Äîthe delay and lack of communication at the front desk were frustrating. i still chose to let it go that time, hoping it was a one-off issue.

however, during my second visit just two weeks ago, the experience was worse. my appointment was scheduled for 5:00 pm, yet i received multiple calls beforehand accusing me of being late. despite that, my sister and i arrived exactly on time. upon entering, we were met with confusion‚Äîthe staff asked why we were there and seemed unaware of our booking. we were shocked by how disorganized the front desk was, especially since they had just called us minutes earlier.

when we questioned this, the lady at the front desk‚Äîsaloni, i believe‚Äîwas extremely rude. she did not apologize, even when we expressed our concern about being treated poorly despite arriving on time. she went as far as questioning whether we had ever visited the salon before, and even suggested checking the security cameras to confirm if we were telling the truth about our previous visit. she kept asking for photos or proof of our last manicure, which felt very accusatory and disrespectful.

the salon was also visibly unclean, which added to our discomfort. despite all this, not once did saloni acknowledge any fault or offer an apology. she simply stated, ‚Äúthis won‚Äôt happen again,‚Äù without showing any accountability or basic hospitality.

while i want to acknowledge that your nail technicians do quality work, the management and customer service at the front desk were extremely disappointing and unprofessional. because of this, we‚Äôve decided that we will not be returning.",1749055054,2 months ago,en,Nandani Arora,True,True,True,False,False,False,True,True,True,True,True

review which i posted above was before getting refund, i was sitting in the salon and writing it.

first of all, stop lying in your response. i was convinced to get full service and not get refund after u shared ur no refund policy image. i only came back because you said you‚Äôd redo the service completely and promised a complimentary hair spa as an apology for your pathetic service the first time. instead, after wasting my time again, you demanded ‚Çπ1500 more halfway through the service. you didn‚Äôt even have the red cat-eye color i wanted, forced me to go with yellow (which i never liked), and then had the audacity to refuse to do nail art unless i paid extra.

after realizing your unprofessionalism, i asked you to either provide the proper service or return my money. your team was sent out to get the color i wanted, but as expected, you failed there too. then you were not ready to refund me properly or even give plain gel polish without creating a scene. after arguing and wasting my time, you refunded me ‚Çπ500, leaving me with nothing but frustration and unfinished nails.

now, regarding your claim of providing a ‚Äúcomplimentary spa‚Äù, that‚Äôs an outright lie. no spa was given. stop using fake claims to cover up your incompetence. as for the claim that my friend used abusive language , another blatant lie. my friend never said anything inappropriate. clearly, this is your cheap way of diverting attention from your lack of professionalism and inability to provide what you promise.

your excuse about me arriving late? another lie. i arrived at 4:30- 5 pm after calling you, and if your team is too slow to complete a service in 4+ hours, you should‚Äôve said so beforehand. don‚Äôt use your own inefficiency as an excuse to blame me. if you‚Äôre so confident about your timing claims, why not check your cctv footage? oh, wait, you probably won‚Äôt, because it‚Äôll expose your lies.

google reviews are indeed for feedback, and that‚Äôs exactly what i‚Äôm doing: telling people the truth about how terrible your salon is. your response is full of false accusations and shows zero accountability. it‚Äôs laughable that you‚Äôre trying to shift blame onto me after scamming me, wasting my time, and providing the worst service imaginable.

instead of hiding behind false statements and blaming customers, why don‚Äôt you focus on actually improving your salon‚Äôs service? but based on how you handled this situation, i doubt you have the guts or professionalism to do even that.

for anyone reading this review: do not trust this salon. they will scam you, waste your time, and then blame you for their shortcomings. stay far away.",1736760468,7 months ago,en,Pooja Shukla,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,True,True

just to mention i have also provided her with a sandwich and coffee (on her request) from a 5* star hotel i was put up at in parel (which is not cheap).

keep reading!!

i recently visited this salon for an acrylic nail refill and left very disappointed with the experience. i arrived a bit late for a removal, but the receptionist kindly said they could accommodate me for a refill as well, which i appreciated.

however, as it got closer to closing time, things took a turn. the staff started packing up, and the technician working on my nails became noticeably rushed. during the process, my pinky finger was filed too aggressively, causing it to bleed. when i expressed concern, she brushed it off saying, ‚Äúkuch nahi hoga, it‚Äôs just dead skin.‚Äù being only my second time getting my nails done, i wasn‚Äôt sure what to believe, so i reluctantly continued.

what upset me further was her telling me i should‚Äôve come earlier or made an appointment. i actually tried calling ahead, but the phone was switched off‚Äîsomething i informed the receptionist about later. it felt like i was being blamed for something out of my control.

once she rushed through the shaping, another technician quickly painted my nails without checking them. i didn‚Äôt push back because, frankly, i just wanted to leave. i paid a high price for a refill and didn‚Äôt even get a basic level of service‚Äîno water offered, no final check, and worst of all, my pinky is now swollen and painful. i also noticed bubbles and lint in the polish on my thumb.

i genuinely hope my pinky doesn‚Äôt get infected, but this entire experience left me very uneasy.

suggestions:
1.	management should clearly inform the staff whether or not they have time to take on a new client before seating them‚Äîespecially close to closing time.
2.	nail services require care and time. rushing compromises both safety and quality.

for the price i paid, i expected far better. a refund or at least a sincere apology would be the right thing to offer in situations like this.",1750654581,a month ago,en,Anuja Bhandare,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,True,True,True

i‚Äôve never had similar experience from other salons and those manicures last for a month with next to no chipping or peeling!!

edit-to respond to the comment below:
-i would be really interested to see the recording you have. my sister and i were polite and didn‚Äôt even really get into it with you to have been ‚Äúrude‚Äù or ‚Äúobnoxious‚Äù- you were mean about the way my nails looked for some reason‚Ä¶ which is strange given your profession and the reason you have a salon:/
- secondly, your staff was so super kind, so i  didn‚Äôt even have a reason to talk badly to them‚Ä¶
- and lastly, i‚Äôm a little worried about your ability to lie through your teeth about something you have 0 proof about. please do post the recording you are so confident about, because the only thing that it will show is you telling me about how my nail beds are small and me telling you politely the design i want:)

2nd edit in response:
- i told you that i didn‚Äôt want the service at all. you made a big fuss about how you don‚Äôt take cancellations and therefore i got the service that made the most sense to me. i would‚Äôve left happily once you had told me you couldn‚Äôt do what i had requested - you don‚Äôt make a customer feel bad and then insist they have to get a service because your time is more valuable than ours.
